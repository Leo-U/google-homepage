This is Leo J.'s Google Homepage Project!

Here I should add a self-reflection of what skills I have demonstrated by completing this project.

8/30/2020: I've finished the project. I've learned that I really don't understand e.g. pseudo-classes, using ids vs. using classes (I only used classes in this project), or what floating does exactly (I used it to position items in the navbar and the footer). I had to use inline styling to get the page to look the way I wanted, and probably repeated a lot of code unnecessarily. Basically, my understanding of inheritance needs a lot of work.

The instructions said to ignore hover effects, but I included them because it was fun.
